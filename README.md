Key Features and Functionality
​This C++ project is a math quiz game that allows the user to test their arithmetic skills.
​Customizable Game: The player can choose the number of questions they want to answer for each round.
​Difficulty and Operations: The game offers four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Mix) and five operation types (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Mix).
​Immediate Feedback: The program gives instant feedback on whether the answer is correct or not and displays the right answer if the player gets it wrong.
​Score Report: At the end of each round, a summary report is generated, showing the total questions, correct answers, wrong answers, and the final result (Pass or Fail).
​Replayability: The user can choose to play again after the current game finishes.
​How it's Structured
​The code is well-structured with enums for difficulty (enLevel) and operations (enOperation). A struct named stGameInfo holds all the game data. The functions are organized to handle specific tasks, such as StartGame and StartQues, which makes the code modular and easy to manage.EnterKKey Features and Functionality
